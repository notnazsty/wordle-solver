The goal of this project is to create a very simple wordle solving cli.

Working somewhat as of now. Certain guesses will sometimes not clear enough of the word list to make the game playable. 

Potential Future Fixes-
- Faster Algorithm for finding the best guess
- Efficient way to store precomputed data to replace the memoized hashmap.
- Using enums for the feedback variables.
- Parallel processing to speed up functions.
- Check the rust get_best_guess to find out why it isn't equivalent to the TS version
- GOAL: Avg solution of 5 guesses.
