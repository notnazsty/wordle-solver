The goal of this project is to create a very simple wordle solving cli.

Working somewhat as of now. Certain guesses will sometimes not clear enough of the word list to make 
the game playable. This will usually cause the program to eat away at your memory.

Potential Future Fixes-
- Faster Algorithm for finding the best guess
- Efficient way to store precomputed data to replace the memoized hashmap.
- Using enums for the feedback variables.
- GOAL: Avg solution of 5 guesses.
